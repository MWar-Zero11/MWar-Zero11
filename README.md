Hi!
Welcome to my profile. I'm relatively new to coding and I'm currently learning web developing, specifically front end web developing. I am looking to change careers as I have spent many years as a high-end sports video editor in the US and throughout Europe.
I currently have 3 Sports Emmys for producing and editing but it's not sparking my creativity as it used to and with all the recent advancements in tech I have found myself drawn to coding. So hear I am on my learning journey!
